      # The packet preprocessor gets the packets (one per datagram received on this data link) and 
      # extracts a timestamp and a sequence count from it. For historical reasons the default packet
      # preprocessor is the IssPacketPreprocessor, which reads packets according to the ISS 
      # (International Space Station) definition. The generic packet preprocessor reads a timestamp
      # in number of milliseconds since 1970 as well as a 4-byte sequence count. The location of
      # both of these values in the packet is configured below. We could also configure it to 
      # expect the last two bytes to be a checksum if we specified a errorDetection value below, 
      # like:
      #
      #   errorDetection: 
      #      type: "CRC-16-CCIIT"  # Can be "CRC-16-CCIIT" or "16-SUM"
      #
      # but by not specifying any errorDetection value we disable the expectation that the last two
      # bytes have a checksum. We use the generic packet preprocessor because it allows us to
      # receive simple UDP packets with a protobuf-encoded ParameterData object, prefixed with a 
      # timestamp and sequence number as described above and configured below. This means we don't
      # need to mess with CCSDS in our "fake lander" app.

      # A custom class derived from GenericCommandPostProcessor. This version loads a list of
      # from a file, where each line of the file is loaded as a separate string. Each string
      # should be the name of a command sent from the ground system to the rover. These strings
      # must exactly match the ones prepended to serialized F Prime message data that is being
      # sent to the Rover.  If the first bytes of a received command match a the UTF-8 representation
      # of one of the valid command names, then those matching bytes will be stripped from the
      # message and the remaining data will be sent.  
      #
      # The absolute path of the file can be specified using a "validCommandNameFileAbsPath" 
      # argument within "commandPostprocessorArgs". Alternatively, if a

      # named "validCommandNameFile.txt" in the configuration ("etc") directory.
      #
      # The final result of all of this is that the UDP datagram that will be sent for the 
      # command will contain only the binary blob of F Prime message data intended for the 
      # rover. Or at least, that's the hope.
