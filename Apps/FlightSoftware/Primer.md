## Component and Input Port Types

3 Types of Components:

```
        | Owns thread  | Message |                    |
Type    | of execution | Queue   | Input Port Types   |
========|==============|=========|====================|
Passive |     No       |  No     | Sync,Guarded       |
Queued  |     No       |  Yes    | Async,Sync,Guarded |
Active  |     Yes      |  Yes    | Async,Sync,Guarded |
```

Passive components define the base level of functionality for all components. Queues extend
the passive component class by including a Queue for each async input. Active components 
extend queued components by including a `start(..)` method which starts a task for that
component. In FreeRTOS, this method only creates the thread, but does not start the
scheduler. These component base classes are defined in `Fw/Comp`.

The autocoder generates the following call chain for synchronous and guarded inputs:

- 0:   Caller: `retType <output port name>_out(args)`                      (_ComponentAc.*_)
- 0.5: Callee: `retType m_p_<port name>_in(args)`                          (_ComponentAc.*_)
- 1:   Callee: `retType <port name>_handlerBase(args)`                     (_ComponentAc.*_)
- 1.5: Callee:    lock mutex if input port is guarded                      (_ComponentAc.cpp_)
- 2:   Callee: `retType <port name>_handler(args)`                         (_Impl.*_)
- 3:   Callee: User implemented behavior and returns retType               (_Impl.*_)
- 3.5: Callee:    unlock mutex if guarded input                            (_ComponentAc.cpp_)
- ... return up the call stack back to the caller

Note that we were on the caller's thread of execution the entire call.

For asynchronous inputs the autocoder generates methods which are called when initially
starting F-prime. In `constructApp()`, the `start(..)` method is called which creates the
task for that component. The task function pointer is an internal method to 
`ActiveComponentBase` called `s_baseTask`. This task has the loop function for the task
and defines the message for breaking out of the loop and destroying the task.

In this "event loop", the `doDispatch()` virtual method is called which is generated
by the autocoder in ComponentAc.*. The call chain for async inputs is as follows:

- 0:  Caller: `void <output port name>_out(args)`                     (_ComponentAc.*_)
- 0.5:Callee: `void m_p_<port name>_in(args)`                         (_ComponentAc.*_)
- 1:  Callee: `void <port name>_handlerBase(args)`                    (_ComponentAc.*_)
- 2:  Callee:    `<port name>_preMsgHook(..)`                         (_ComponentAc.*_)
- 3:  Callee:    Serialize args and add to queue                      (_ComponentAc.cpp_)
- ... return up the call stack back to the caller

Event Loop
    1. `doDispatch()`
    2. BLOCKING dequeue args
    3. void `<port name>_handler(args)`
       User implemented behavior
    loop

The blocking nature of the message queue ensures that if there is no messages to
parse, another task can pre-empt this task until there is something to do.

Queued tasks which have no thread of execution must call doDispatch() in its implmentation
to handle asynchronous messages.
